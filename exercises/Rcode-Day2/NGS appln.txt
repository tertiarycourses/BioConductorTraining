reads --> start by matching to reference
all reads mapped to reference genome

#1  variant detection

find new SNPs, 
take a sample of DNA and align to genome, see if person is heterozygote
at a particular bp location (low p value)
also see if person is missing a base in allele



#2 RNA-seq

gene expression
take RNA, convert to DNA, align all the reads
a lot of reads in sample A align to gene 1 rather than sample B
therfore gene1 more expressed in sample A 



#3 CHIP-seq

binding sites for TF

align the reads to DNA, which location has enough reads (peak detection)
to lead us to believe that a protein was bound to that site.
